#Task 1 Plan 

Ways to simulate a network
>Build it on gns3, configuiring settings of routers and connetcions to replication differnt critical infrasrutures, Positives - I have used before - allows python intergratioon, Negatives - can get complex 
>Cisco Packet tracer, Positives - meant to be very user friendly, Negatives - never used before 
>OMNeT++â€™s, Positves - built for adavnced projects, works well with c++ , Negatives - never used, complex. Looks like best choice so far 

hows it going to work 

within critical infrastruce there are many differnt applications and connections, builing these will by creating a centeralised system with minimal protetcion will act as a satarting point

parts of a critical infrastructure network, Control units,
